# Welcome to Introduction to Engineering

This is a course textbook to give a general introduction to the engineering issues in the field of Computer Science, especially for the issues raised in the scope of data science. This course also intends to provide a set of practical artificial intelligence and machine learning skills to help the students to work as a data scientist and provide potential solutions to the data engineering problems.

This course is mainly for the third year foreign undergraduate students in East China University of Science and Technology (ECUST)  and the tutor of this course is **[Dr. Fangli Ying](https://fangli-ying.github.io/)**(应方立). He is a Lecturer in the department of Computer Science at ECUST and he creates this **fully open-sourced executable notebook [[Github repository]](https://github.com/Fangli-Ying/Introduction2Engineering)** for the online course of "Introduction to the Engineering".

## What we will learn from this course

- The fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence and some applications using machine learning algorithms
- How to apply A.I. and M.L. to help to solve the engineering problems in computer science and we demonstrate a number of applications with simple executable python code examples.
- The principles of machine learning approaches and the development of data science applications in the era of big data.

## What are the tools for this course

- Programming Language: Python Only
- Tools: [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/), [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), [Numpy](https://numpy.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/),[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [SkLearn for ML](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [Keras](https://keras.io/) and [Pytorch for deep learing](https://pytorch.org/)

## Usage

All chapters are written as [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) combining explanations and example code. When teaching, I use [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) and [RISE](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to showcase them as live presentations.

The content of this site is designed to be browsed thematically rather than sequentially.

```{admonition} Interactivity
:class: tip
From any chapter, you can launch a live session in the cloud by pressing the <i class="fas fa-rocket" title="rocket"></i> button in the toolbar above and selecting a hosted runtime environment. You will be able to test the code and regenerate the chapter output.
